# Changelog

All notable changes to `kgsm-reactor` are recorded here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed — a first setup on a host where nothing is installed yet completes

`deploy/setup.sh` enables its unit at boot and starts it only when something exists at the unit's
`ExecStart`. A host that has never deployed this project has an empty prefix, so the unit is enabled
and left stopped, and the summary names the unit that is enabled but not running and says
`deploy/deploy.sh` is what starts it. The fresh-host path is `setup.sh` → `deploy.sh` with nothing
in between.

The grant verification adapts with it, and still makes two real polkit-gated calls: `daemon-reload`,
plus one `manage-units` call on this project's own service — `start` when the service is running
(systemd queues a no-op job), `try-restart` when it is not (documented to do nothing for a unit that
is not running). Both are dispatched as the same `manage-units` action, so a host without the grant is
refused either way and the probe measures the grant rather than the unit.

⚠ Measured in the positive direction only. The deploying user on the development host is in
`wheel`, and two pre-existing polkit rules there grant that group every
`org.freedesktop.systemd1.*` action outright, so no systemctl call by that user can be refused
and the negative path cannot be exercised on it. That `try-restart` consults polkit before it
decides there is nothing to do is systemd's own dispatch order, not something this host can
demonstrate.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-18

The observing half — the leaf runs, watches and records. It decides nothing and acts on nothing.

### Added

- **The leaf itself.** A Native-AOT `net10.0` daemon, deployed by the ecosystem's standard
  `setup.sh` once / `deploy.sh` forever pattern, with a leaf config descriptor generated from its
  typed settings and installed where kgsm-api scans for it.
- **Federated event ingestion.** Reads every producer's journal through one `IEventSource` — all nine
  on a full host — at the tail and with no cursor, which is the ecosystem's rule for a consumer that
  acts.
- **Classification.** Each event reduced to the facts a later rule would be built on: a reporting
  bucket, whether it is about a server, the host or a component, and which one. Raw rather than typed,
  so an event type this build has never heard of is still recorded with its subject.
- **The observation ledger.** SQLite over raw ADO, keyed on `(producer, segment, offset)` so a
  re-read costs nothing, batched behind one transaction, pruned on a retention window.
- **The population report** (`--report [--days N] [--ledger PATH]`) — the three readings the rule
  table has to be designed against: rate and burst shape per event type, repeat interval per
  (type, subject), and how long each candidate condition takes to resolve itself.
- **Lifecycle reporting.** `leaf_ready` once ingestion is genuinely running, `leaf_degraded` when the
  ledger cannot be written, `leaf_stopping` on the way out. The deploy's health gate reads the first
  of those out of this leaf's own journal, bounded by a stamp taken before the service starts.
- 56 tests, hermetic.
